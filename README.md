# Music Bot (Uses youtube)

# My version (Owner of fork speaking)

Just so i can flex my godly programming powers and my years of experience I decided to turn someones decent code into 100x better code just so I get an ego boost.

I basically just took their code and imporved it drastically.

## Installation

1. Clone repo

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/DanielOrourke02/discord-music-bot
```

2. Create venv and install requirements

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

```powershell
pip install discord
pip install spotipy
pip install yt-dlp
pip install PyNaCl
```

3. Add your bots token to config.json

4. Start the bot

```powershell
python spotify.py
```

## Enjoy
